Windows Phone Finance Application (Deprecated)

Development: Aborted

Start Date: Sometime in 2011
End Date: End of 2013 

## Why?

In 2010-11 Silverlight was my primary focus in development. To me it didn't matter what the business needs were as long as I was using Silverlight. Right out of school I was fortunate enough to get a 6 month contract working on ASP.NET websites and start a new project using Silverlight. My manager was awesome and let me use whatever (Microsoft) technology I wanted as long as it got the job done. In hindsight, Silverlight was the wrong technology to use for many reasons... but the job was done.

Once my contract expired I still wanted to use Silverlight. I still considered myself to be intermediate with the technology and wanted to work hands on with a company that was already using it. Once again, I was extremely fortunate and took a position that was converting an existing ASP.NET website to Silverlight. My first hybrid. I could speak to the experience gained from this gig for hours (maybe in some kind of blog post?).

Anyways, I was using Silverlight professionally and starting my love\hate relationship with WCF services. Professionally we were using MSSQL but not Entity Framework or any other ORM for that matter (stored procedures FTW?). At this time ORM's were on the rise and Entity Framework was just getting started. NHibernate was the top dog. 

## Enter Podcasts: Windows Weekly and Windows Developer Show

This maybe the origin of why I got started in Silverlight and Windows development. I had always listened to Leo Laporte since I was a yound adolescent. In late college, I started listening to another one of his shows "Windows Weekly." I believed the hype, followed the Microsoft business and I even bought the first generation Windows Phone 7. Yee Ol' Samsung Focus.

I knew Windows Phone 7 ran on Silverlight and felt this was a perfect time to write my first mobile application. 

## Inception

I struggle the most in finding a good idea to build upon. The other is maintaining the passion to complete said idea. I wanted to build something that would apply to my needs. As most people, financing can be a struggle and hard to keep up with. Why not try to make this easier? (I discovered Mint a few months after development started) I continued anyways because I still liked Silerlight and working on this application improved my skills on a professional level. 

(I'll add more details about develop later.)
- Silverlight
- MVVM Pattern
- Messaging instead of events
- WCF
- Entity Framework
- Unit Testing
- Dependecy Injection and Inversion of Control

## Finally

I learned more by building this application than anything I have done professionally. Getting the hands on experience alone with Dependency Injection and IoC paid dividends later on. I did release a few versions of the application but was (finally) losing favor in Silverlight.

This application has it all in terms of architecture. Database, Service Layer (API) and Client application.

I'll try to dig up some screenshots.
